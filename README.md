# Dislocation Motion in the Presence of Diffusing Solutes: A Computer Simulation
The movement of dislocations plays a critical role in the determination of the elastic and plastic properties of any metal. The addition of solutes has been determinental in increasing the physcial properties of metals and succh products are called alloys.
